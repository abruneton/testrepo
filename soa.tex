\section{The freeform algorithms at hand - An overview}
Several procedure have been described in the litterature to compute 
freeform optics. We review here the most relevant ones, and highlight
their respective advantages and drawbacks.

We also covers the litterature dealing with extended source since this 
forms a major part of this work.
